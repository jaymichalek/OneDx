# OneDx

Created a full stack CRUD application using C#/.Net framework for back end, React for front end, and MSSQL for database.
I came up with this idea Capstone project during my initial training with my employer. 
This full stack web application is a mock electronic medical charting where doctors can log in and add, update, get information 
and delete information for their own specific patients.
Doctors can add/edit/delete patient information such as Name, ICD 10 diagnosis, date of birth, etc.
There is also an "ADMIN" role where only the admin can add a new user as a doctor.
